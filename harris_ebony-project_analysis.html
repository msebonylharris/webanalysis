		<p>In today's society web, surfers are accustomed to view state of the art websites that are 
		not only nice to look at but also user friendly. In this Analysis, we will address the need 
		and importance of a website that caters to the "potential user." The Websites main purpose 
		is to provide information and Links to the Parents, Students and Teachers of Spring Lake 
		Elementary School. In addition, our goal for this web re-design will be to make the website 
		user-friendly and provide an overall better user experience. We also plan on increasing the 
		sites traffic.</p>
		
		<p>We intend on achieving our goals by making the website more compact while at the same time 
		making it easier for the user to navigate to their destination. Although the website is 
		currently cluttered, we know that this website is being used. We do not want someone to have 
		trouble finding information on the new site. To ease the transition to the new website, we have 
		decided to place a "Find it Quick" tab in the Navigation. This way, the user can find what they 
		are looking for without having to go through the entire website. </p>

		<h3 id="competition">Competition Analysis</h3>

		<p><a href= "#main_nav">Back to Top</a></p>
		<p>I looked at the Villages Charter School, and Berkely Charter School as competitors. I 
		noticed that they had pages that were easy to navigate as and for the most part, user 
		friendly. I felt that the colors used by Berkley Charter school were a little too loud for a 
		school website, but it has a great layout. I like the way Berkley adds its calendar and news 
		to the front page. This is something that I hope to incorporate into my website. I noticed 
		how The Villages Charter School used side navigation. Although this looks good, I do not feel 
		that it would work for what we are trying to achieve. I believe that the layout Berkley Charter 
		school makes a perfect example of the elementary school website I intend to implement. </p>
